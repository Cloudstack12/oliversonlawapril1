                    <ul>
                        <li>Charged with a criminal offense that was either dismissed or resulted in a not guilty verdict at trial; or</li> 
                        <li>
                            Arrested for a crime and charges were not filed; or

                        <li>
                            Convicted of a criminal offense and has since completed all of the terms and conditions of their sentence, including the payment of all fines and obligations to any victims.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once you have completed all of the terms of your sentence, including serving your jail/prison time, paying all court ordered fines, fees, and restitution, and are discharged by the court, you will still have to wait a period of time before you can file the petition to seal depending on the type of offense you were convicted of.  The necessary waiting time is:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>

                <h2>
                    What does Sealing Your Criminal Record Mean?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you are charged or convicted of a crime, that criminal record follows you for your entire lifetime, and it seriously affects your ability to get an education, to find a job and it can even hinder them in finding a place to live. This means that even though you have served your jail time and completed everything you were ordered to do by the court, you can still be discriminated against.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you have your criminal record sealed, the records relating to the crime are hidden from public records, and no one can view the contents of the record without a court order. When a record is sealed, employers, landlords, and schools that run a background check will not come up with any record of your criminal conduct.
